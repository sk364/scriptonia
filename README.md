# scriptonia
A collection of interesting scripts for fun


1. scripts to run a command remotely over SSH using python paramiko, allowing user to pipe commands directly into a ssh connection.
2. Bypassing the proxy to remotely connect to nodes from outside the intranet.
This project aims at finding a way to bypass the proxy of intranet network and hence reach any node of the network from outside the intranet.
3. Miss call communication
This project uses missed calls to communicate or send a message to a person.
It works like this, we can give a missed call to a person and if the missed call lasts for more than 10 seconds, its a zero else its one. This way we can send any message in form of binary numbers. Also we can use the concept in a different way that the number of seconds the miss call stands for, is the alphabet(in serial order).

4.Personalised time table
Using the existing time table of institute, we need to create personal time table for a student of a selected branch and batch extracting info using his roll number and other details.
